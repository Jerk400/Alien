AliEn is a lightweight Open Source Grid Framework built around other Open Source components using the combination of a Web Service and Distributed Agent Model.

It started within the ALICE Off-line Project at CERN and constitutes the production environment for simulation, reconstruction, and analysis of physics data of the ALICE Experiment.

The current status of the ALICE grid operation can be found at the MonALISA Grid Monitoring.
